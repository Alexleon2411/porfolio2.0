                    <p>
                      I am a passionate individual who loves music and enjoys relaxing by playing soccer, though my favorite hobby is reading books. With a year of professional experience, I have been working extensively with Vue.js and Python, honing my skills and contributing to various projects.
                      In my recent role at Madic Benelux, I have been working on a project called Konnectr-Admin, which focuses on managing the company's data. This experience has allowed me to design, implement, and ship several key features, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our data management processes.
                      Additionally, I have successfully designed, implemented, and shipped a clone of AirBnB and a Rails prototype of www.free-will.me. I am continually working on personal projects to further develop my abilities and stay updated with the latest technologies.
